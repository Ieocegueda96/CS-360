**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
I developed an event tracking app that allows users to keep track of events and send them reminders of upcoming events. The main goal of the app is to help users keep track of their busy lifestyle by adding important events in the app.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
The app is composed of two databases, one for saving login information to differentiate users and another one to save the user's events. When a user opens the app, they are greeted with a login/register screen. Here, the user can either user their username and password to get access to their saved apps or create a new account with a new username and password. The second screen users see is the main screen with all of their events displayed on a scrollable screen. The user can tap on one of these events to see more information about it, edit it, and even delete the event. Users can also add new events using the floating button icon on the screen.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**
Coding this app required incremental testing and close following of techniques that I learned throughout the course.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**
Incremental coding was important, especially on an app that took a lot of different activities to function. I learned that it takes a lot to develop an app and that there are some coding techniques that I could get better at with more practice and experience.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
The first major hurdle was creating a log in screen that worked with a database that saved the user information. I had to look back through the information in the modules and even looked up information online for help with this.

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
I would like to think that in the basic layout design of the app was where I was most able to show what I learned. App design has a lot of guidelines to consider in order to make an attractive and usefull app. Even though my design was very simple and can definately be improved, I feel like the full design of it was a good starting point.
